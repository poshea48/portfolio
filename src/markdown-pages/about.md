When I'm not building a project I will most likely be here...

- on the volleyball court
- on a hike
- at the beach

I made the transition into Software Development 3 years ago, coming from a 13 year career in the Medical Device Field.
My reasons for leaving:

1. Challenge
1. Continuing to Learn
1. Career Advancement

So contact me if...

- You need something cool/fun/challenging to be built
- You want to collabarate on something
- You want to talk shop
- You have some thoughts/ideas or comments on how I can improve on any of my projects
- Want to chat about some beach volleyball
- You live in Maui and want to play some volleyball
- Just want to say hi!

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, you can reach me at...
