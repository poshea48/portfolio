### Aloha World!

#### ![its Paul](../images/thatsme.jpeg)

My name is Paul O'Shea,

I enjoy solving problems and building solutions using these technologies...
####Frontend

<div class="tech">
  <p>JavaScript/TypeScript</p>
  <p>React.js</p>
  <p>Next.js</p>
  <p>Gatsby</p>
  <p>React Native</p>
  <p>Redux</p>
</div>

####Backend

<div class="tech">
  <p>Node</p>
  <p>PHP</p>
  <p>GraphQL</p>
  <p>Postgresql</p>
  <p>MySQL</p>
  <p>MongoDB</p>
</div>

I also love to learn new technologies/practices and build upon my foundational knowledge of Software Engineering in order to create the most efficient solution

I made the transition into Software Development 4 years ago, coming from a 13 year career in the Medical Device Field.
My reasons for leaving have now become the core values I look for in building my new career

1. Strive for challenge and to be pushed past my limits
1. Learn something new everday
1. Never be statisfied with the status quo

I live on the island of Maui Hawaii, with...
