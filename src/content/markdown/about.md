I made the transition into Software Development 3 years ago, coming from a 13 year career in the Medical Device Field.
My reasons for leaving have now become the core values I look for in building my new career

1. Strive for challenge and to be pushed past my limits
1. Learn something new everday
1. Never be statisfied with the status quo

So contact me if...

- You need something cool/fun/challenging to be built
- You want to collabarate on something
- You want to talk shop
- You have some thoughts/ideas or comments on how I can improve on any of my projects
- Just want to say hi!

Thank you for taking the time to learn about me, you can reach me at...
