Aloha Basecamp,

My name is Paul. I live in Maui, Hawaii and I‚Äôm ready to start the next chapter in my story. One where I am not the only character, but instead surrounded by other creative and supportive people also driven to build great solutions. The Research and Fidelity Department is the place where I want to start this chapter and fulfill my core values:

> ‚úÖ always learning: From a team operating under a positive-feedback loop, there is no stopping what can be discovered and accomplished together. My addiction to learn more will never end. I have learned so much already, in fact, I am starting to hear that little voice telling me, ‚ÄúMaybe you don‚Äôt need React.‚Äù (ü§´, you never know who‚Äôs listening!)
>
> ‚úÖ always growing: In a supportive environment, I‚Äôll be free to unleash my inner drive. My growth curve will be linear.
>
> ‚úÖ always seeking a challenge: I can continue to write in languages I love, but pushed to utilize them in new and creative ways. I will embrace the space outside my comfort zone.

How did I get here? It was actually because of you, Basecamp! I know. It seems crazy, right? Let me explain:

In December of 2017, my girlfriend, Abigail, and I were contemplating a move to Maui for her to pursue her dream job researching whales. Meanwhile, I was in the middle of my online software development curriculum at Launch School, so no big deal, I could do that wherever. Then, reality hit. Maui‚Äôs not exactly a Tech Hub, so what the heck would I do there after graduation? I blanked.

As I battled through this fog of uncertainty, I stumbled upon ‚ÄúHire Managers of One.‚Äù That article was talking about me! I needed to know, who was out there looking for me? So down the rabbit hole I went: ‚ÄúSignal vs Noise,‚Äù Basecamp, your products, and the clincher: your culture. I was hooked. What emerged at the end was a clear picture of my future in Maui and the reality of building a career in the middle of the Pacific. On top of that, I, like Abigail, discovered my own dream job. I wanted to be a Basecamper.

Like any great origin story, my path into Software Development was filled with defining moments; none bigger than the leap I took away from my past career.

For 13 years, I worked with The LifeLink Foundation. I led a specialized team in the final quality control of tissue donations before they were used as grafts in surgical procedures. Early in my career, I quickly persevered past the company‚Äôs internal timelines for advancement by creating roles and opportunities for myself. What I was told I could do in 1 year, I found a way to do in 6 months. In the end, I peaked early and my growth in that environment had reached carrying capacity. What kept me coming back for so long was the impact I was making on the recipients of these grafts: the end user.

Outside the walls of LifeLink, I created an environment for myself that pushed me to think and learn outside my comfort zone. I learned to play beach volleyball, I took courses ranging from Calculus to Creative Writing to Stock Trading. The more I learned, the more I wanted. This addiction took hold of me and led to the leap of faith into Software Development and the forging of my core values: always learning, always growing, always seeking a challenge.

Almost four years from when I started this journey, I call myself a Full Stack developer. While I have written backends with both Rails and Node, my main focus has been on the client side, so I should consider myself more of a Frontend developer. But ultimately, I‚Äôm just a guy that uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to solve problems. As these problems continue to grow in numbers and in complexity, so too does my skillset. I incorporate a new feature I learn into each one of my projects. I am more focused on finding the more efficient solution rather than the more comfortable one. My goal is to be a great developer not just a great JavaScript developer.

So that‚Äôs me, Basecamp, everything I could give you in letter form! It has been an honor and privilege to share my story with you (and after listening to the Rework podcast, I know you‚Äôve been an attentive reader). I look forward to the next step because I have so much more to share and even more to learn.

Thank you,

Paul O‚ÄôShea
