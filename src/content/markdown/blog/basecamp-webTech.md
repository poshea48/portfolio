I think I might have become a JavaScript nerd. I don‚Äôt say that in a ‚ÄúI know so much about JavaScript‚Äù kind of way. What I mean is - I like to listen to people talk about it and read about it at really strange times. For instance, I listen to JavaScript podcasts at the gym. Let me tell you, there is no better motivation to getting up that last squat than hearing about the latest library someone is trying out. In all of my nerdy outlets over the past year, the terms JAM stack and Gatsby kept coming up. So what do I do? I try it out, of course. It seemed strange at first using a static generator to produce dynamic content, but I quickly became a believer. Initially, besides the blazing fast performance, what I liked most was how easy it was to get up and running. As I continued to use it and as I read deeper into the documents, I uncovered a world of magic living behind the scenes.

A prebuilt webpack config gives you code-splitting, prefetching and other great functionality right out of the box. I like not having to mess with webpack! There is a rich array of starters, plugins, and themes for abstraction and code reusability. I have created my own starter that I use in every project, which makes start up even easier. I didn‚Äôt have a true appreciation to how great Gatsby‚Äôs GraphQL integration was until I built my own in a Next.js project. Abstracting the backend into lifecycle APIs makes it all the more easy to do what I do best, write client-side JavaScript. Hold up‚Ä¶separation of concerns (minus the React), easy setup, prefetched resources, plugins, MAGIC? This sounds a lot like something I have already used ü§î.

That is what I love about this field: the exploration and discovery of new, more efficient solutions is a never ending cycle. Maybe the next great web technology could be a server-less framework powered by Rails with Stimulus and Turbolinks under the hood. Maybe that already exists ü§∑. I could definitely get into that!
