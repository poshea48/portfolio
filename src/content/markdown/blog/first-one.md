Aloha World, thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. This will be the first of many posts I write outlining my journey as a Software Developer. I should of started this earlier (it would of been quite hilarious to look back at my earlier thoughts), but I didn't, so here we are. I understand the importance of this much more now.

I recently applied for a Programmer position at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com), and the biggest take away of spending two weeks to submit an appication, is that I need to get better at writing. I'm not talking about writing code, though I do need to get better there as well, what I am refering to is writing about writing code. I read blogs like this all the time, and they are great for learning. But when it comes to articulating that knowledge, I am not where I want to be. I think this will help.

The two weeks I spent researching and writing this application was just the foundation to the new addition of my development. Im hoping to build something great here, let's start this!
